I'm living in Warsaw, Poland.

This is my 2nd app ( Bull's Eye was 1st :) )

I want to start search for junior dev job after Bootcamp;
was working as music engineer for last 8years, but due the lockdown and lack of musicians coming to the studio i am basically unemployed with no income staying at my parents house.
Therefore i'm learning how to code.
I'm using Apple products since 2007, i'm a lot into IT and tech and music of course ( recording&editing not creating :) )
but till now my knowledge about programming was only theoretical.
